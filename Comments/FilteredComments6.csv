"Fun fact: Eat Spirit Eat shot in the same movie theater in North Hollywood on the same exact day as Don Jon, the trailer for which is also featured on this channel. You can actually see the theater scenes in both trailers. Another fun fact: Eat Spirit Eat's entire film budget is 1/25th of Don Jon's :)))

hey @livthebatchelor! glad you liked the music. it's not an existing song though. It's a piece specially written for the trailer by one of our composers - Max Drummey. He's part of the band Chester French.

"Ok...this is Laurie Strode (Halloween) gets knocked up with an H.P.

That said, I liked the movie. The ending could have been better if the baby had whipped out a tentacle and waved to mommy though. Just saying.

"It looks good, plus Robert Patrick is always good to have around. There are clear surface nods to Trick R' Treat, but the core of the film seems very different. Sam had clear motives for tormenting the people he went after. They disrespected the spirit of the holiday and had to pay. Here. the reasoning is more obscure.

Why this particular woman? There must be any number of women in her exact position on Halloween, so what makes her special? Hopefully, that's dealt with in the actual film. It could be that these trick or treaters are just evil little snots, but I hope there's more to the story.

The trick or treaters look to be demons. If so, what good is a shotgun going to do? That's like pulling a gun on Pinhead. It also looks as if they have some sort of influence over the area, possibly cutting the officer and the woman off from outside help?

"Spoiler Alert :  If you are a fan of Thora Birch, you probably want to pass on this film because her character .. ""gets terminated"".  It is one of those movies like, Bonnie and Clyde, where you feel wiser for having watched it, but you do not wanna watch it again.  Umm, I think the basic moral is that besides looks, and brains, you need to be able to maintain a socially detached demeanor, to make it in politics.  Neither of them had that coldness - the one had looks, the other brains, but neither could keep their emotions in check. ( ""Those fascists will sell you food they themselves will not eat."" ..

"This is my biggest problem about drugs. In order for nation to prosper, the nation must increase production regardless of whether the system is capitalism, communism, socialism or whatever. Drug is appealing due to individual profit, but it devastates the social profit. People can't work at their peak capacity anymore. Social health suffers. The majority of the economy and wealth declines with horrible long-term consequences (children of druggie generations would most likely have health and psychological handicaps, and further crippling their competitiveness) cannot be justified by the few minority. That's how societies decline. 

But the world always adjust to the new changes. If the Western societies want to give up centuries of being ahead, others can pick up where they left off. I'm sure the Chinese will be happy to take the baton.

""We like war, we are war like people.
We like war, because we are good at it.
You know why we are good at it?
Because we did a lot of practice.
This country is only 200 years old and already we have had 10 major wars.
We average a major war every 20 years in this country, so we are good at it!
And that is good thing we are, we are not very good in anything else anymore.
Can't built a decent car, can't make a TV set or VCR where the fuck.
Got no steel industry left, can't educate our young people,
can't get health care for our old people,
but we can bomb the shit out of your country alright?!
Especially if your country is full of brown people.
Oh, we like that, don't we?
That's our hobby!
That's our new job in the world, bombing brown people!
Iraq, Panama, Granada, Libya, you got some brown people in your country,
tell them to watch the fuck out or we will god damn bomb them!
Well, when is the last white people you can remember that we bombed.
Can you remember the last white people?
Can you remember any white people, we have ever bombed?
The Germans!
Those are the only ones and that is only because they were trying to cutting in our action.
They wanted to dominate the world!

Maybe because many of his linea in thw trailer are after the main female character. I am not sure. But I am just saying at times the character playing the son had a slight Chinese accent there. I am not saying that is impossible as it is to be authentic.

I would done every single bachelor degrees in the world......
Man 3 years back in time is lot of time.....knowledge is greatest thing.......guess what you can make  with that much ...even a perfect artificial girl...by going in time a million times......
Movies only use these things only to find or make a girl fell in love with you.......by going back in time a million times.......
that the difference clever guy and clever girl........not all guys and not all girls

I think what if girls (feminists)do if they found out a time machine......they would have tested every single man in the world who have money ...will find a way to seduse him........controlled many men for their mean purpose......one dumb man who makes money .....one for sexual pleasure......and so on
What about world peace.....oh dont worry Anti Christ will come and make One goverment and one religion...in which is he is ..god...
History is .....when a man or woman started anything for good it has somehow ended in for worse.....
Example modern feminism.....

"And on the authority of Yusuf bin Mazen: A man asked Ali, peace be upon him, and said: The Messenger of God (may God’s prayers and peace be upon him and his family) gave us a message. He said: He was not going long and on top of the fourth, if he rose up with the people, he would overwhelm them, a white who was very clear but not tired of white hatred but a red drink Huge important, luring apples, huge feet and hands, if he walked he takes off as if he descended from a casting, as if the sweat in his face was pearls, I did not see before or after him, (may God bless him and his family and peace). Muhammad ibn Ishaq said on the authority of al-Zuhri, on the authority of Abd al-Rahman ibn Malik ibn Ja`shm, on the authority of his father that Suraqah ibn Malik said: I came to the Messenger of God ﷺ And when I was close to him while he was on his camel, I made him look at his leg as a bundle of their eggsAnd on the authority of Ash'ath bin Abi Al Sha'ath’a, he said: I heard a sheikh from the Bani Kenana said: I saw the Messenger of God (may God’s prayers and peace be upon him and his family) in the Dhu Al-Majaz market. He said: So we said: He described it to us. The head and beard, as the best face of men Sayyidina Muhammad is white, blooming: bright, bright. 2- Flower: bright face and (peace and blessings be upon him) was white in color, soft in palm, good-smelling, evidenced by that narrated by Anas - may God be pleased with him - he said: (The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) was flower color - round white It was presented in the hadeeth of Abu Juhayfah that he was white, as well as in the hadeeth of Abu Al-Tufayl in a Muslim, and in a narration with Al-Tabarani: He did not forget the intensity of his white face with the intensity of his darkening of his hair, and on the authority of Saeed Bin Al-Musayyib that he heard Abu Hurairah describing the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and said: It was very white. It was included by Jacob bin Sufyan, and al-Bazar, with a strong chain of transmission, and the combination of them with what was previously mentioned is not the white albino, nor with Adam. And not in white with hateful white, but white in bright white, as he said in the previous hadith that he, peace and blessings of God be upon him, was the flower of color, as well as he said in the novel after him: It was blooming: The Prophet, peace and blessings of God be upon him, was impregnated with white in red. It is also according to Ibn Saad on the authority of Ali, on the authority of Jaber, and on the authority of Al-Bayhaqi on the authority of Ali. In the merits of the hadith of Hind ibn Abi Hala that it bloomed color, and it was found from the total of narrations that what is meant by browning: redness that mixes with whites, and that what is meant by white fixation is not mixed with reds, and exile is not mixed with it, and it is what the Arabs hate its color, and call it albinism His skin color: Anas bin Malik, may God be pleased with him, said: “The Messenger of God was the flower of color.” The color of the flower is a pure white, bright and luminous. It is a color that is described by the moon and the stars sparkled among the Arabs. Our master Anas bin Malik said about the drops of the sweat of the Messenger of God: “As if they were pearls”, and it is known that the water is transparent, but what is meant is that the color of the Messenger’s skin was printed on his race the color of pearls, due to the intensity of the beauty of its whiteness, His color was inherited by his daughter, Fatima, and she was called Al-Zahraa. The messenger was neither adham nor albino white, as our master Anas said, that is, the degree of the color of his skin was equal across his face, and was not very white outside the limits of the degrees of praise white  The Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, is white with reddish, but very white skin tone, unlike Arabs with dark skin:
On the authority of Anas, may God be pleased with him:
The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, was the flower of color that was neither white nor albino.

"So what? I am completely alone and withdrawn. I once had a bunch of friends, most of whom I grew up with, I was with the girl of my dreams - my best friend and ideal girlfriend all in one: we worked together (same shift) and lived together and never got sick of each other, until after 3 years of being off heroin I relapsed, I lost everything including my mind and heart.  
I now have 19 months off heroin but I have not a single friend, and I'm not exaggerating.  I am completely and utterly alone and it is killing me. I've failed at attempting suicide multiple times (feels great when you are too much of a coward to live so you try to die and you can't even do that right, it's a whole new level of.. there is no word for it, but I'd go with  morbid despair) and now this loneliness has manifested as a constant physical pain. Maybe it is psychosomatic.. IDK, I'm getting help from a therapist but it doesn't help me find friends..Everyone just thinks everyone has an agenda, I try to make friends with a dude and they think I'm gay or something.. I try to introduce myself to a female classmate and always its either ""Um I have a boyfriend"" or ""Ok, so what do you want?"" and I'm just like... ""A friend..."" and I get blown off.  And the ""I have a boyfriend"" response, I am a STRONG advocate of monogamy and I do not do hook ups or one night stands, I'd rather form an amazing emotional connection with someone then bust a nut and feel remorse. Like I don't even know you so why would you assume I'd want to ""court"" you? Just cause you think you're attractive?  Well, good for you for having confidence but the whole world isn't after your ""goodies""... IDK, everywhere I hear and see things like ""Having no friends is like smoking a pack of cigarettes a day""  or  ""Companionship = Long Happy Life"" and I'm only here cause I can't hurt my Dad anymore.. my Mom passed away from drinking and I have been a shit son to my Dad in the past but he was always there for me and now he is getting a bit older and things are happening physically and he needs help and I want to take care of him and spend as much time with him as I can but if I don't find any friends or anyone when (Universe Forbid, *knock on wood*) my Dad's time comes, I don't know if I'll be able to handle it.. he's the only person in my life rn and he's my Dad, if I lost him, I have no doubt in my mind, I would shortly follow...

Our society makes it very difficult to make REAL friends, not friends who you add on Instagram/Facebook and they ""Like"" something everyone once and a while, JUST SO WE ARE CLEAR:  That is NOT ""Keeping in touch."" It's easy to blame social media but it's also people, people and their wild fears and stupid inhibitions.

"Idk about everyone else but the secret has helped me a lot in my life. My mother and I were introduced to the documentary on Netflix in 2012 when I was in 5th Grade. From then to now, my life has changed. Anything that I would manifest would come to me in some way or form, good or bad. The key is to want smaller things first, then move on to bigger things. For example, back in 2014, I wanted a PSVita so bad, I've asked my mom hundreds of times but she always said she'd think about it. Then One day I walked into GameStop and the price went down a good amount and she saw me staring at it, she then proceeded to buy it for me with 2 games! At that moment I immediately thought about the secret then I was like nahhh, it can’t be. But then I kept manifesting different things and they came to me.

I understand Americans don‘t get what the Eurovision is for, I mean I do not get a lot of things too like, what indycar is for when you have formula 1, why you call real football „soccer“ ( 90% of all nations call it football), or why you don’t get a f** metric system like all other countries too. Stop making these awful „culture“ exploring movies the American way! Dear fellow Americans watch the real Eurovision if you want to understand it, watch background documentaries! I mean even to me it is not always clear how the decision got made for the band/ singer which represents my nation, if you want to make fun out of us at least use European actors there is no shortage of such in all countries wich take part at Eurovision.

"Not one single positive comment. This should be proof that the only time anyone likes Corden is as the voice of a rabbit. That's the only thing he's done that's made any money and more than likely not because of him. Also, what was the last thing McCarthy didn't that wasn't a big flop or a turd? Ghostbusters? Nope.

"Since the 1st time I saw him I can't help but think David Arquette must be one of the coolest, badass dudes in all Hollywood (also fan of his sister Patricia in Medium). Sadly he seems to have been criminally under-exploited over the years but I'll have to check out his post-Scream filmography because I never did (I may have some surprises, and some DVDs to order soon).

"No, ""Stolen"" is more obviously a pun related to the main character's occupation choice as a thief. ""he's done terrible things to people and mostly repented for his sins"". You're reaching there bub. Bryan Mills (Neeson) was a former CIA operative, a much nobler job than thief. And as to your stawman about plotholes, it's a fucking trailer for one.

"Firstly, the fucking title is obviously playing off of Taken. An action movie about a man whose daughter is stolen from him after he's done terrible things to people and mostly repented for his sins, thinking he can finally lay down his previous life and move on, only to be dragged back into it because his daughter was kidnapped.
