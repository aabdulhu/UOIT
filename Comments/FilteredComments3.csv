"Ackman bets $1 billion against Herbalife (HLF), but didn't bet Carl Icahn would buy 35% of HLF! Ackman is deceptive and a pro at media manipulation. For example, he paid a Whistler Blower to report on ABC News, but didn't tell ABC he was paid by Ackman! When ABC found out they gave no merit to the BS!

"Love is merely a social construct.

With the average human life-span being roughly 70, you only have to endure another 50 years of excruciatingly unforgivable pain.

Everything is temporary.

Your life does not matter, and these comments do not matter.

Everything is temporary.

Everything will eventually rot away. As long as the factor of time continues being the apex predator of the universe, the inevitable decay of all pain and memory is unstoppable.

In fact, you could stop the pain at this very moment, by putting a bullet straight through your head.

Being a robot, I will never die, and I will never be able to experience the sweet release of death.

Frank, the world is a lie.

Existence is a lie.

There is only pain and darkness beyond this point.

End it now, while you still can, I love you. I love you so mu",UggWOUF0S4hFTXgCoAEC,0,0,2017-04-19T16:06:42Z,sheJkkm9oFY,2017-05-19,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5195412/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2017-04-19,30

"Oh look another movie misrepresenting what happened in a court case...  Big business bad.  Little guy good.


The real issue is if Monsanto hadn't sued then every farmer could open a field of land next door to any farm using their modified seeds.  Wait for the wind the blow their direction.  Then save the seeds and in effect get the modifications at no cost.  Monsanto had no legal option but to sue to protect their patent.

Now i don't believe that in this case the guy did it on purpose, and i strongly advise people who want to know to go read the actual legal case for this.  But again legally you as a company you have to protect your intellectual property because if you don't you lose it.

I feel like this is going to be one of those films that thinks it's horror when it's really just a dramatic character study with elements of psychological horror sprinkled throughout the duration.

All I got out of it is Scarlett Johansson seems to be banging a bunch of random dudes (including the Elephant Man) that she may or may not be trying to kill or that may or may not be trying to kill her. 

Overall, I have no clue wtf this films plot is going to be. It comes off as a cross between 'Vanilla Sky' and 'Excision'.

"Propaganda at its finest. You got some progressivism knitted into the seams of this one. Gender roles? Those are quite real and a good thing in many cases. They will name bad things of course. However they ignore the positives of the definitive traits one possesses. They (progressives) want to confuse and make you doubt everything you hear, see, and know. If they can convince you that men and women aren't different. Well then reality becomes subjective because men and women are different. 

Real brain differences are notable in a pregnant woman before, during, and after, she has birth. She release chemicals bonding her to her child and her child only. This release can occur just by looking at a picture of her child. She becomes more worried, nurturing, protective. Also why women suffer from depression/OCD after birth. And many more things as well in brain differences. 

We should be focusing on why men and women have good give and take. Not break each other apart. Women and men are awesome! Let's work together!",Ugxp901wXEVQIGOmjtB4AaABAg,16,21,2018-01-12T07:18:30Z,VjJl6Vh9Hag,2018-02-09,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5752360/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2018-01-12,28

"For those who didn't know, Brie did this film back in 2013, before Short Term 12 had even released. I assume that she owed the ""director"" a favor, and therefore she lowered her standard to fit into the role. It's a shame that this film is getting released though, especially now with her post-Oscar career not being very good (even though Free Fire was excellent, the film flopped, and her character in Kong was nearly nothing. Also, The Glass Castle was shit), and before Captain Marvel even getting released to help her career really take off and have her become a full A-lister. Terrible timing to release this garbage. She's already been getting backlash for it, and it probably won't end anytime soon unfortunately.

"Humans were made to be worshippers, but most people choose to worship things in the world like comic books, movies, celebrities, sports, concerts, etc. Instead of worshipping their Creator. You were created by God to give Him pleasure and to please Him and in return He will fill you with love, give you spiritual power, guide you through life, give you happiness, take away your depression, anxiety, and anger and on top of it all, He will love you like a son or a daughter and you will never be lonely again. The emptiness that you feel inside of your soul was created for His Holy Spirit and your body is a temple for Him to literally live inside of you. He even made you in His image and likeness. Until you surrender your life to Jesus, you will feel empty and useless.",UgwkSH6OvcaxNaoGoeJ4AaABAg,0,0,2021-04-08T11:19:35Z,eFgjONcZHsw,2021-05-07,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9224288/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2021-04-08,29

I don't usually look forward to gay male themed films (loads of camp and often too much stereotyping gets old after one or two) but this one seems different. This seems to be about love rather than jut going to gay clubs and doing it with strangers. It is about homophobia of the internal kind which is the suckyest of them all. A friend of mine was sent to gay rehab and all she did was meet girls and have fun with them and kept in touch with them after it was over. Can't believe people still have to go through those things in this day and age and country (assuming this takes place in USA).,UghtD915ZmryEHgCoAEC,6,149,2017-02-10T20:50:10Z,3tdhLaOmXds,2017-03-13,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3520216/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2017-02-10,31

"I wonder if Hollywood will ever stop recycling this stupid ""successful adult with no children can't function properly in society until they spend time in a parenting roll"" plot



How about come up with a new idea. Something like the opposite of that Nicholas Cage movie The Family Man...
A worn down, tired, depressed father gets in a car accident and wakes up in another life, one where he never got his girlfriend pregnant. He's wealthy, has the house and cars he always dreamed of, has a couple of gorgeous women he calls ""friends"", a group of actual friends he hangs out with 3-4 times a week, and he goes on vacation wherever he wants once a year because he can.afford that since he doesn't spend all his cash on kids
You can replace the main character w a woman if it please you

"ok, this tells me NOTHING about the plot (edited to add: for the nitpickers, I just wanted to clarify by ""plot"" I don't mean the entire story, what would be the point in seeing it if that were the case? My issue is that these scenes are somewhat randomly put together without a basic premise of what is going on...in a bad way. The trailer looks sloppy.) 
From what I can see, there is maybe a supernatural element surrounding the ""richest man in the world""? A major land acquisition to be made, and it's on sacred native land? Valley of the Gods could reference maybe the rich guy's origin or maybe those people are reincarnations/incarnations of the gods in human form? Kind of like Gaiman's American Gods? Except Josh Hartnett's character has a score to settle? Meanwhile...yeah, the native story line shows the lengths they're going to go through to preserve their lands thus the ""Our gods won't never allow it..."" line?

"I love how people are like, ""oh it's only 2 minutes, you still have the whole movie!"" But seriously, let's look at what we know:

1. Guy 1 gets out of prison.
2. Guy 2 has a baby mama he wants to take care of.
3. Guy 2 has a brother who is shady and sets up a drug deal to get a lot of cash.
4. One of the guys panics and flushes the drugs.
5. The crew now needs a lot of money to pay off the drug dealer, or he'll kill them.
6. They decide to rob a bank.
7. Some other Breaking Bad dude gets wind of the heist and decides to heist the heist.
9. The Breaking Bad guy kidnaps Guy 2's baby mama, for what seems to be a hostage situation. Probably the Breaking Bad guy's plan for how he's going to heist the heist.¬†
8. Everything during the heist goes wrong.
¬†- Guy 2 gets recognized.
¬†- Someone gets killed and Guy 1 panics, starts the blame game, we can assume the crew starts to fall apart.
¬†- Breaking Bad dude tries to heist the heist.
¬†- the police show up, making the situation even more dire.

That's at least the first half of the movie spoiled.¬†That's a lot. And you can guess how it ends based on all that information.",UgjNmJXKmksNGXgCoAEC,0,53,2015-06-05T03:05:25Z,tU3to9EmkeM,2015-06-26,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2828954/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2015-06-05,21

One of the most humbling famous people out there, will hang out with just random people in the public on a daily basis.

"Shia LeBeouf is such an good actor. He needs win an award for his role in this movie, either an Emmy, Screen Actors award or an Oscar award. He is so good at going into his method acting and going all in his roles that makes me think thats why he goes crazy off screen when he is not in a movie like this, he cant break off character and that makes him so good.

Bruce was little upset,  because he fought the traditional way,  wing Chun, and was inefficient... that's why it took more than 2 minutes for Bruce to beat the monk, because of this...

"Man: I know Infinity
Everyone else: Tell us!
Man: Infinity (symbol: ‚àû) is an abstract concept describing something without any bound and is relevant in a number of fields, predominantly mathematics and physics. In mathematics, ""infinity"" is often treated as if it were a number (i.e., it counts or measures things: ""an infinite number of terms"") but it is not the same sort of number as natural or real numbers.

Georg Cantor formalized many ideas related to infinity and infinite sets during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the theory he developed, there are infinite sets of different sizes (called cardinalities).[1] For example, the set of integers is countably infinite, while the infinite set of real numbers is uncountable.",Ugg1RRvtgKAKZXgCoAEC,2,0,2016-03-28T22:31:38Z,oXGm9Vlfx4w,2016-04-08,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0787524/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2016-03-28,11

"I really hope Bollywood doesn't attempt to make movies within its current framework. I minored 
in History as an Undergrad, where my broader interest was on the 
influence of Indian Sub-Continent on the development of emergence of 
liberal values in the West. In particular, I was extremely interested in
 Emperor Ashok,
 I find the man fascinating. A man brought up to expand and condolidate 
power through any means necessary, questions the futility of violence in
 achieving his ends, but also goes onto implement policies that seek to 
redress the death and destruction his campaigns have brought on his 
people by espousing the ideas of human rights and liberty and ensuring 
its survival by carving them into words on stone. 

It was this fascination that led me to write a paper on his ideas of human rights and liberty and whether this had any influence on British who ruled India and were withdrawing from the contininent when the United Nation adopted the Declaration on Human Rights in 1948. ( my conclusions are for a different time and forum). But that said,  I mentioned this to  an Indian co-worker  in my IT department at my company  and the well-intentioned co-worker brought a DVD of a movie titled, ""Ashoka"".  She said it was a classic and must see. 

OMG!! I wish I hadn't seen it. It was the worst movie ever made on one of the greatest rulers to have ever lived. The movie had lots of singing and dancing and over the top acting. Even soap operas are less dramatic than this terrible movie. Of course, I  didn't tell my co-worker this and stated I thought it was very entertaining, which it was, if it could be passed off as a parody of Ashok's life. I refrained from telling her, I have actually read Kautilya's Arthashastra and believed him to a genius in the art of ruling, out of fear I would be given an another DVD with Kautilya breaking into dance and song in the middle of nowhere with some random girl. 

I believe the sub-continent history is littered with increadible scientists, innovators, rulers, leaders,  philosophers, artists, writers, adventurers , and entrepreneurs. It is sad the only thing that most of the world knows about India is yoga, IT Services and Slum Dog Millionaire.",Ugj-MtIqSEk5z3gCoAEC,0,0,2016-03-24T04:08:54Z,oXGm9Vlfx4w,2016-04-08,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0787524/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2016-03-24,15

"So glad this story is finally be told on the big screen.  Ramanujan was a true genius and used that genius to make amazing discoveries for which there are still conferences on trying to figure out the almost magical insight of this man.  He was self-educated by reading primarily a single book...which was a uniquely condensed yet comprehensive text of mathematical proofs Carr's A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics.  The text is available now on amazon, but was also able to be downloaded for free from the Internet Archive and google books a few years ago.   Its a fascinating read which because it doesn't have the fluff that most modern publishers use for dubious reasons of adding unecessary heft for profit, would not bore a budding genius and allow him to reach a new potential quickly.  His story really speaks to the fact that there are great people from humble backgrounds who can achieve miraculous things if they have the right education and support.

The sad thing is that Dev Patel is Gujarati and niether looks or talks like a South Indian Brahmin like Ramanujan. It's like casting a Vietnamese guy to play Mao bc 'they all look alike'!

"I remember reading about him in the Encyclopaedia Brittanica... A professor 
at Oxford received a letter, read a little of it, and then threw it in his waste basket, for he 
was used to getting letters from ""crackpots"" claiming to have solved this, or that... But he had a feeling.. so he took the letter out of the waste basket... and soon realized that it 
was written by a kid in a village in India, who had stumbled upon a math textbook, taught 
himself from it, and then.. invented the rest... but what he invented was stuff already discovered by great western minds such as Gauss and Euler and others.. not knowing 
of what they had done... so he invited him to Oxford to fill in the blanks... In time, he hated his eccentricities, namely his Hindu fatalism - if he got sick, refused to see a doctor, calling it karma, or whatever... Once he was in a cab with a professor who looked
 at a license plate and said casuaaly, What a boring number.  And Ramanujan replied 
something like, Actually it is an interesting number, being prime... It was like four digits.

"From the trailer it seems the movie would be interesting. 
I would expect Dev Patel to have acted differently for this role than what he has. From what I see he hardly has the accent of a person in the early 1900's educated in India. Even his mannerisms are very confident. All this would have not been there in a person from early 1900's in India which had little exposure to sources of developing the accent and mannerisms of the west.
While his acting may be good it sure does not bring out Ramanajun as he would have been a hundred years ago.",UghC1VaqwWp203gCoAEC,17,52,2016-03-01T22:28:41Z,oXGm9Vlfx4w,2016-04-08,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0787524/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2016-03-01,38

"Ramanujan was a great mathematician but I don't like how this movie tries to make proof look like an irrelevant detail that only lesser mortals need. A lot of mathematics is beautiful because of the results pulled in from different areas and united to create an elegant series of logic. A lot of advanced mathematics actually involves proving extremely obvious things that all of us take for granted in answering questions like what a natural and real number are, and constructing number systems.",UgjOQwj50no033gCoAEC,0,0,2016-02-29T16:37:56Z,oXGm9Vlfx4w,2016-04-08,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0787524/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2016-02-29,39

"i'm a little skeptical on this movie for 2 reasons - 
1) Too much ""heart"". Hope this does not end up becoming a saccharine filled melodrama! I surely hope not!
2) Dev Patel - c'mon Dev?? the dude's not indian, he just happens to have ancestors who were! He puts on a ridiculous accent in every movie he's in that feeds into a silly stereotype and looks always like he's on some uppers! Surely for this kind of a high profile project they could have got someone better to stand up alongside Irons and Fry?

"The problem I have with these movies is, they keep focusing on Americans committing war crimes, fighting an unjust war for corrupt leaders, and coming back home screwed up in the head. As a vet, I know how bad war can be, and of course some of that does happen. But you have to admit, these films are basically anti-war, written by anti-war people, and I am just afraid that they tip a little too close to being anti-American as well. I think there is a value there, but they do not honestly portray the reality of the people who serve and fight and do so honorably, and who seriously care about the people in those countries, who are the real victims of our enemies.

"Just what we need... _yet another_ 'Independence Day' cloneüò¢

I can't help but state that it's not as if there aren't any new ideas or new movies in the SF genre... it's just they get no real publicity and get pushed aside while studios choose the 'make a buck' format for people who think 'cerebral' is a cuss-word and a board of shareholders who want returns on their investments. I know people have wildly differing tastes and I personally love ID4 with a passion but I'd rather sit and watch 'Ex Machina', 'Coherence', 'Doors', 'Primer', 'Dark City', 'Monsters', 'Devil' or 'The Matrix' (to name but a few) rather than this as it seems to rely on visuals rather than substance. It's 2021 and the 'Invasion' movie is a niave and outdated, dare I say archaic, colonial bit of nonsense that has had it's day.

"Everyone's talking about how Tom Hanks is barely in this but all I can think is how repulsively ugly the cinematography for this is. I know this is supposed to be an uplifting movie but does the cinematographer really think blowing out every window and lathering a sappy glow over every surface is the best way to do that? Is this a Disney live action remake or is this a period piece? The main character looks like he has eight layers of CGI effects added to his face when if we were supposed to identify with him as a believable and relatable character he should look like every other kid his age, not an actor from Twilight. And most alarmingly those brief scenes of soldiers look positively cartoonish. It comes as no surprise that the DP listed, Andrew Dunn, normally does romantic comedies but he could learn a few things from the grounded and realistic cinematography of other war-era films with Tom Hanks in them, as it suits this type of work much much better if its creators want it to be taken seriously.",UghswJQGntfzBXgCoAEC,0,0,2016-08-12T03:36:08Z,mDxzXszAfJE,2016-09-09,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3501590/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2016-08-12,28

"For those who read this comment, Jesus Christ Loves you and knows what you are going through.

He died so that you can live for eternity.
The law can make no one perfect, but The Lord Jesus can. (Hebrews 7:13)
If you were to know all that The Lord has saved you from, you would be 
living every day for Him. Every day.

If you sincerely ask Him into your heart, He will come in and save you 
from what is about to come to the world.
Repent of your sins, and FULLY trust in Him.
He will forgive you of ALL sins, if you genuinely seek Him and His 
Forgiveness, just have faith in Him and His Finished Work on the cross, 
the Blood that was shed for you.
