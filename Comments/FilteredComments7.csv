"The trailer starts of believable and I was thinking ""oh it's a cool new movie set in WW2"" 
Then there is a monster and I'm like ""ok√© so it's going to be some cool horror movie in the sky"" 
Then they show the monster and It looks dumb and I'm disappointed that they even show the monster in the trailer, because it ruined the tension and suspense. 
After that it's all action cuts and the woman protagonist is amazing at everything which seems a bit forced. I was onboard at the beginning when the men don't believe her and she proves them wrong, but in the end it just gets so forced when the woman protagonist has to be better at everything. (Ps. if it was a man in the protagonist role it would still have been forced and over the top.)

"Al Capone is a legend of a bad man, he was a criminal genius and I feel that tom hardy can portray that role correctly. However this film doesnt seem like the correct portrayal of Al Capone. The trailer makes the film look like a horror film and the make up on Tom Hardy doesnt look anything like the man named Al Capone. Al Capone was over weight and he did have a horrifying scar on the lower part of his left cheek that is portrayed on the makeup but the makeup makes Tom Hardy looks like a pale dead person and looks like a horror clown without the red smile and nose.

"""One of the reasons war is created in this world is because it is far more exciting than peaceful living here. You notice when peaceful times exist, society starts to degenerate, and then there is a big war. Everyone then gets a tremendous sense of temporary purpose and vitality. When war is finally over with terrible destruction, people enjoy peace for a few years, and then there is a new war.
Everyone talks about peace on the planet, but there are very few people who could tolerate it. There are very few people who could live in a world of peace. They are ill prepared. You have left a world of peace to come into this world. Peace is possible here, but you must prepare yourself for it. You cannot be living in conflict and hope to have a world of peace. The bullets will still fly and nations will still assault one another.
No one can tolerate peace for long because if your environment is peaceful, your anger begins to come forth. If your environment is not peaceful, you do not realize your own anger. If you were in a room with no stimulation at all, a very peaceful room with no aggravation, your own anger would come forth. You would realize that you are at war already. You are struggling against your own Knowledge. You are fighting with yourself. That is why there is not peace in the world. There is only peace to the extent that people can tolerate it. So you will not have peace in the next decade because people cannot tolerate it. If the world were without conflict, it would be like the little room with very little stimulation.
To the mind that is cultivated, the room without stimulation is a wonderful place. To the mind that is in conflict, the room without stimulation is a terrible place. To the mind that has been refined, the silence of the wilderness is a wonderful experience to be cherished. To the mind in conflict, it is an aggravation.""

"Connection terminated. I'm sorry to interupt you Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name, but I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You're not here to recieve a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume, although you have indeed been called. You have all been called here, into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labirynth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach. But you will never find them, none of you will. This is where your story ends.

And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you, although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away, as the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still, and give up your spirits. They don't belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although for one of you, the darkest pit of hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting old friend.

My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms, the way you lifted others into yours. And then, what became of you? I should have known you wouldn't be contempt to just disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now.

This film looks decent for only a 5 million dollar budget but the film seems its not gonna take its self seriously. Maybe the film will be good but from the looks of some of the animatronics like Arty The Alligator it looks kinda fake you can see a human in the custome. The film will most likely be a Rated R with the tittles Horror/comedy.

"Even before I checked the IMDB credits, to see who the director was, I had already guessed this was a Terrence Malik film. The guy just has such a distinctive style - a style that is visually stunning, but at the same time accompanying a narrative that meanders to the point of being pointless. A perfect example of this was his film Tree of Life.

"Everyone who isn't familiar with Terrence Malick's works will think that this is a normal drama movie, however, for him, it's just about the visual aesthetics, as he's actually a good documentary filmmaker (and in my humble opinion a pretentious filmmaker).

"Omg... Jason Blum you just killed your career with this pg-13 re-hashing of this once 90's favorite cult classic. Why did you decide to have this particular director navigate this movie?  There were so many appropriate horror candidates and veteran directors to properly redo this. This was so disheartening to watch and will suffer the same fate of crap like Carrie 2 and so on... In fact, Blumhouse is pumping out cookie cutter films lately with very few sustenance to even come close to giving cred to their horror status. It is simply not and quiet frankly BH has had to rely on associate production companies such as Ghost House to keep up appearances. My question here to Jason is did he make the conscious decision that the original was overtly sexualizing the main four actresses?  Was it too real and dark?  This version goes the complete other end of the spectrum with hired actresses that look like they are 16 yrs old and scenes ripe with cheap looking snapchat filter effects. I had high hopes for a next level version and this is just so disappointing to put it mildly or maybe I'm just to old for this crap... thank god for the classics I can watch anytime by people who actually know how to make great movies... then only thing great about this is its failure.",UgwgnBnwtjzLt0dNo8N4AaABAg,0,0,2020-10-03T02:37:25Z,yPIwK_RiMeA,2020-10-28,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4685762/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2020-10-03,25

"I was eight when the original film came out, so I was a bit younger than the target demographic and didn't grow up with it. But even as someone who knows OF the '96 original instead of being a lifelong fan, this version looks like a soulless cash-grab. Which is really disappointing, since I think a new ""The Craft"" movie could work if they did something other than rehash the original plot. There's so much more you could do with the concept, especially since the witchcraft/modern Pagan communities have become more socially acceptable since the '90s. Oh, well.

I haven't thought of a logical reason for the picture of Fairuza Balk aka Nancy Downs that was used for the Polaroid, but in the original film, the picture of Sarah's mother moved..so we will have to wait and see!

I'd rather have one enormous lady with two tremendous eyes
Than 20 with 40 of ordinary size!
I say, let's join those darling daughters -- I mean, join them to each other --
And make one great huge mother!!

In the damp and sultry weather,
The ladies tend to stick together, anyway.

"A Sad Story....
A girlfriend gave a challenge to her boyfriend
to live a day without her. No communication
at all and said if he passed it, she'll love him
forever. The boyfriend agreed. He never texted
nor called his girlfriend for the whole day
without knowing, his girlfriend has only 24
hours left because she was dying because of
cancer. After a day, he excitedly went to this
girlfriend, ‚ÄúI did it baby"" but tears fell as he saw
his girlfriend lying in a coffin with a note
you did it baby.. now please do it everyday..
I love you.""

Instead, your mission will give something back to you that the world cannot provide, something of far greater value that only you will be able to give to the world.

"DC needs to use their own variation of Marvel's algorithm, it works. That much is obvious, we fans just want to see great DC movies like this is going to be, Wonder Woman, and Man of Steel were.

But that Batman V Superman should have never been made, that movie lost all the momentum DC had goin from the Dark Knight series and Man of Steel.

"Aqua man spoilers!





Just watched. It was a fun movie, and great effects. It will do good, but it‚Äôs not a masterpiece per say. It‚Äôs just a fun awesome movie, what dc needs. William dafoes character dies relatively early. Black manta is only shown suited up in 2 scenes. The character behind manta, appears in one of the opening scenes where aqua man invades a ship. He gets beat up. Another scene shows him taking the suit and walking away. Then there is a huge land fight you see in the trailer. He gets defeated when he is chasing aquaman, and Mera comes out of nowhere and cuts of his head. He survives, just the metal part was cut off. They threaten him, and run away.  King orm dies by aqua mans trident, but aquaman does this healing thing to him and he gets locked away in a Atlantis prison. Those are the main parts and deaths. Black manta is in like 5 mins. Aquaman gets his suit at the end, right before the king orm final battle. The end credits is we see a shore, and a huge wave flies by. Out of the sand is a green lantern ring.

"DC is going to run into a problem. They have Superman, Wonder woman and Shazam already established. They are way to powerful so the bad guys have to be over the top. They are going to have to reboot it every 10 years of it makes it that far. As for the movie it's still just ok looking but I have a feeling it's going to fail bc no one cares about him. Aquaman had old woman going for Khal Drogo. Wonder woman was sub par and that's with one of the hottest woman alive. The villains are bad and the heros are worse.

"God Loves You Perfectly





But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.

Romans 5:8‚Äì9
God is a God of forgiveness. He knows you perfectly and still loves you perfectly. We are slaves to the idea that if someone sees our flaws, they won‚Äôt love us anymore. Well, while that may be true in human relationships, God is not like that.

God sees all our imperfections, failings, and flaws on Jesus at the cross. Our sins and ugliness do not turn Him off. In fact, to Him they are occasions to demonstrate His grace and forgiveness through the blood of His Son, who has removed all our sins efficaciously at Calvary.

So don‚Äôt be embarrassed about your flaws, mistakes, and imperfections. God knows your weaknesses better than you do, and He loves you just the same. His Word reminds us that Jesus is not someone ‚Äúwho cannot sympathize with our weaknesses.‚Äù Instead, Jesus was tempted in all points, yet He was without sin (Heb. 4:15). He understands every temptation and every trial that you are going through. He is not disappointed with you, and He is not waiting for you to live up to a set of dos and don‚Äôts before He forgives and loves you. The Bible says, ‚ÄúBut God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him‚Äù (Rom. 5:8‚Äì9).

Did you get that? When did God love you?

That‚Äôs right, when you were still a sinner. Before you even knew Him, when you were still in sin, He already loved you. How much more today, when you have been cleansed by Jesus‚Äô blood and made righteous! Having received Jesus‚Äô righteousness, you are righteous forever. Even when you fall into sin, your sins don‚Äôt make you a sinner again.

When you fall short today, you are still the righteousness of God. This is because your righteousness comes from Jesus. In the same way that a beautiful butterfly cannot morph back into a caterpillar, once you have been made righteous by the blood of Jesus, you cannot morph back into a sinner. Knowing your righteous identity in Him then gives you the power to overcome every sin, every addiction, and every bad habit!",UgzlRAjiMEWcFmMxFgR4AaABAg,0,0,2020-08-14T11:01:16Z,WKcTj5wDgzU,2020-09-16,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7395114/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2020-08-14,33

"To anyone who reads this.. Jesus loves you, so much more than anyone on this earth ever could! He died for you and me on the Cross, conquering all sin so that we could be free, and have acces to a life beyond, where there is no more agony or worries; only pure joy and everlasting happiness.. up there in Heaven!  This may be true, but the only way for that beautiful Sacrifice to have complete effect, you need to accept Jesus as your Lord and true Saviour, and repent of all sin.  This is because we are binded to a flesh that will succumb to all kinds of desires, a flesh that is binded with sin by nature, sin that God doesn't love, and wants us, through that acceptance, to turn away from it and become pure.  Jesus wants you to be part of His eternal family, and wants to help you, strengthen you, fill your heart and restore you until the day we actually meet Him.  Life with Him is so much easier; Don't lose this chance because of this world's vanities. What we go through here and acquire is only temporary, and God wants us to strive for more than this... He is very close!
