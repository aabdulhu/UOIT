"Looks too conventional. I'm all for treating LBJ with political respect ( he was after all the most skilled politician ever to rise to President,) but this looks conventional, ill-cast, rubbery and slight.

Yes, he allowed McNamara to escalate the War in Vietnam, which was a terrible error based on technocratic policies that infested every level of the government and military. Yes he habitually referred to 'nigras' as a politician in Texas, NO he was not a racist: he went to incredible lengths to destroy Richard Russell who WAS, and pass the Civil Rights Act. he had a horror of poverty and his War on Poverty could have made him one of the 20th centuries great presidents if he hadn't got bogged down in fighting communism. Nothing apart from the Civil Rights Act and enfocing voting laws could help black Americans more than a war on poverty. From his policies, he was a force for good for African Americans. And he was  more honest man than either Kennedy, those preening liberal hypocrites, and he never almost started a nuclear war. But he was Southern, and vulgar, and instinctive rather than highly educated, and incredibly wily, and he had no principles beyond being politically effective.",UgznK3U_4X_Z0Ku-JiJ4AaABAg,2,3,2017-10-30T00:09:41Z,xrnEp8WLH0g,2017-11-03,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4778988/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2017-10-30,4

It is also very possible that Woody Harrelson's own father, who was a convicted hit man, could have played a part in the murder. LBJ was an evil man. The only good things he did while president were done for reasons other than the lofty ones we would like to think were behind them.  If I ever gave the chance, I would certainly spit on his grave.

"Lyndon hated the Kennedy's their entourage ridiculed him daily. JFK was going to be dump LBJ in the 1964 V.P. spot. LBJ was going to go jail for his corrupt dealings with Bobby Baker and/or Billie Sol Estes(my great uncle was the first witness called in his Gov./LBJ fraud trial) Lyndon even had a subpoena waiting for him in D.C. the very day JFK was murdered, all investigations were subsequently DROPPED that very day he became president. Sometime in the summer of 1963 LBJ was presented with a choice jail OR presidency, he let the powers that be pave the way to make sure it was going to be presidency. Lyndon knew the assignation was coming that day, he knew the night before and chose to look the other way. Lead organizer of the Warren Comission he only selected men who would tow the line and confirm what J. Edgar Hoover's initial report said. Lone shooter, case closed. Nobody will ever know who shot JFK that and other details are forever lost in a wilderness of mirrors. It doesn't really matter who pulled the trigger. What matters is who EXACTLY got the reigns of our government that day. One thing I do know without any doubt, LBJ could have stopped what happened that day, he is no hero. LBJ after getting the CIVIL RIGHTS BILL OF 1964 passed gloated to an Air Force general aboard Air Force one ""Ill have those n******'s voting democrat for 200 years"" truly a very sick man. One of the greatest moments in our history and he tarnishes it by saying that, a president! LBJ was also a psychopath, and had his own sister, Josepha Johnson, killed on Christmas Eve of all days. But DO NOT take my word for it look it up for yourself when the rest of the files are released in October 2017. I will be watching this movie no doubt and I'm glad they made it, I just hope it is nothing like this trailer represents, but who knows until you see it all the way through. That is what I love about our country we are free to make a movie and put our spin on it and leave it up to the viewer to decide. God Bless America. Much Luv,

"This film is not trying to make a point that ""it's okay to have an affair if you are unhappy and are on a road trip to Paris."" Stop jumping to conclusions, because one, it's just the trailer. You do not know any other details other than that the main actress is uncertain of her happiness of her marriage, and that she is on a road trip with her husband's friendly French business partner. While it is simple to assume that she would have an affair, any film enthusiast or anyone with common sense would be able to know, based on what is presented, especially in a trailer, you do not have all the details of the entire film. Also, this film seems to be a romantic, light-hearted dramedy, with a certain whimsy slightly similar to ""Midnight In Paris."" So having a straight-forward affair as some of you in the comment section may think, would not really fit with the style of the film. And again, you do not know all the details of the film. What about Alec Baldwin's character? Is his character a completely moral individual? And of Diane Lane and Arnaud Viard, did you witness any sexual advances from either character in the trailer? Don't be so narrow-minded and quick to judge. The film, I believe, seems to try to capture the essence of platonic friendship and a time of companionship for Lane's character from Viard's, to help her through her presumed marital troubles, while experiencing the beauty and food of France. See that Lane's character is constantly concerned of rushing to Paris? She is disconnected from the act of experiencing all that France has to offer, only thinking of Paris. Toward the end of the trailer, she grows personally, indicated by her renewed sense of adventure, wanting to take a detour before going to Paris. I believe the entire film will be charming. The ending is obviously uncertain, but to really think that she will definitely be in an affair is rash and unbecoming of any film-goer and anyone with a decent heart. And if she does end up with Viard's character, it is not because of lust, but of a deep connection between the two of them that Lane and Baldwin's character no longer share. The ending will clearly be decided based on the progression and interaction of all the characters through the entire film. So again, don't be quick to judge, even from a trailer.",UghUWlPeU6Z1_ngCoAEC,0,24,2017-04-10T22:36:37Z,HTrT6QSqnGs,2017-07-07,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4429194/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2017-04-10,88

"From a man point of view, yes I'm a male and I feel disappointment.

I used to ""love"" Rachel McAdams for her sweet movies, starting from Notebook to The Vow, but now it is a second movie when she play a Lesbian, is it because she does not get any proposals?

Is she trying to say something, as for me I think her career ended with The Vow, where I think her performance was totally amazing, then True Detective 2 season came out, watched maybe 1 episode, or 2, and this is a totally not that Rachel McAdams I was hoping to keep seeing, then was disappointed to see a trailer for Passion (1st time she played lesbian).

One of the sweetest and probably most respectful actresses in ""Hollywood"" seem to go really bad way according to me! Of course there are people who love to watch lesbians and I have nothing against them nor gay people, but watching one of my favourite actresses that I hoped would always be playing those cheesy, cute,  innocent characters!

As much I recommended all her movies to my mother (we watched all of them except: Passion/ /Tv Series - True Detective, Mean Girls) I would not dare to recommend ""Disobedience"" to anyone, and as much Rachel McAdams is expressing her freedom to play any character she wants, and experimenting with her sexuality, (I read one article when she said she will never show her naked body, but it seems she does seem to go that way, in addition she was actually topless in one of her first - Italian movie) I would love that this movie was her last, and to see her in another romantic or a drama movie without any sexual explicit. 

Does not matter, shame such a talented actress starts to play ""bitches"", ""whores"" and other crazy characters! Well in the end it is her life and decisions.

I feel like I will never see her in a movie that I could cry, or actually enjoy watching, and I keep waiting for each of her new movies but she keeps changing same as it was with Hilary Duff, always telling and singing ""Listen to your heart"" but in the end she gave up and seem to take some mean comments and work personally to the point she lost lots of weight and began to lose her both music and movie career.

While she was playing Disney movies, example: Cinderella Story, Raise Your Voice, and many more... She was this cute loveable person, that everyone admired and then everything spiraled down, and it seems the same for Rachel McAdams. 

Seems like since The Vow with exception of Aloha, the roles Rachel took seem not fitting her usual character though I enjoyed her performance in Spotlight too.

It is my own opinion, and it seems that Rachel McAdams will never be back to the old days when she kept starring in romantic movies.",UgzfcwHsYKFo4NlMqTN4AaABAg,0,0,2018-03-08T20:41:59Z,NpKiUPrNl3Y,2018-05-18,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6108178/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2018-03-08,71

"I usually hate gay movies the same way I hate white, black or Hispanic movies. (Oddly not Asian ones since they don’t seem to horribly pander to the audience with cultural bs). 

But! The fact that they are making a movie like this that makes the relationship between family the main issue and NOT being gay. Is good. Why make another movie about a person dealing with being gay and accepting it if you’re going to do nothing different?

I hate movies that don’t try anything nee.  Even though I think this is going to turn into liberal hogwash. Because it did look like the brother was going to low key try to bone the gay out of his sister at the end. I commend them for doing something new at least.

"LOL another stupid soft-core lesbian porno with a story you can possibly follow. Just because you can doesn't mean you should. Right and wrong as of lately are being misconstrued. In Years to come so called rational people will question if its okay to have open relationships with a animal, men teen boy love or (the saddest of them all) Mommy daughter love. Followed by the statement ""Love is Love"". Crazy? Just 200 years ago a gay rights law would of been considered crazy. The person who thought it up would of been put in a hospital for evaluation. The line has already been crossed, this world is lost. I believe in the next 300 years right and wrong will totally flip, and anybody that stands up for whats right will be prosecuted, and put in jail. People don't like being told what to do or how to do it. ""We live in a world where a man can pretend to be women, and society calls people who don't except that theory a bigot"".

"Was lucky enough to see this at the Glasgow Film Festival, and as the trailer shows, her accent isn’t the greatest. It has it’s moments, but is rather inconsistent. That being said, it is a really great movie, and does Moran justice. So if you can, try not to let the somewhat lacklustre accent put you off, and give this film a chance.

Personally, I don’t get why they didn’t just have Helen Monks from Raised By Wolves play the lead, as she basically played Moran in RBW, and we know she has the accent down. But accent aside, Beanie gives a great performance, that is almost charming enough to make up for it.",UgySr3cIHAEOR08RH0N4AaABAg,2,23,2020-04-09T10:22:44Z,eIbcxPy4okQ,2020-07-24,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4193072/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2020-04-09,106

"Was this intended for Lifetime TV?
It's naive, a poor treatment of Alzheimer's and terrible depictions of Cuba. It commits the sin of ""tidiness."" The children playing on the street look like they're wearing their costumes for the first time. Every environment looks carefully concocted -- even a guy's ""messy"" apartment has fluffed and chopped accent pillows on the sofa.
The music is good, but the dialogue is horrible and direction is unrealistic.

Having said all that, he does start to grow on you when you watch the tapes, and he did seem to at least live by some sort of a code of ethics, relative to his situation of course.

No one sells chicken nuggets in our school. Because we dont eat lunch at school. At 11:30 am we go home eat lunch and go back to school at 1:00 pm. I already had my puberty and I am already in grade 5. And the best part that I am not going to be a zombie. But the worst part I am going to be eaten by Grade 3 students below.

"I have a love hate relationship with chess. American culture hates the pasttime; if not, native born Americans would win repeatedly at highest level rather than nationalized citizens.

Bobby obligates many to push pieces. One learns to master what one can, then play and win what woman or what capital or what grace is available. That's life. Americans want, by contrast, pagan sports festivals, and certainty. Americans (and serfs) crave certainty. The unending combination of moves snd fact the mind might snap before acting keeps chess behind knitting among pasttimes in our vaunted confederation of states.",UggKPpCA4dNJBHgCoAEC,0,0,2015-09-19T04:54:48Z,xFHvH9FtACg,2015-09-25,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596345/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2015-09-19,6

"Looks Interesting,I like how it deals with his racial attitudes towards the Jews,that adds realism,,Fischer made an inflammatory interview on Philippine radio about the Jews.He called them a criminal race and said they should be rounded up and put into work camps until they learned decency,I think that was wrong..
He also  said they mutilate their babies...
Apparently,some of them  do..so I agree with that bit..
look for it on youtube,Bobby Fischer and the Jews..Even though his mother was a Jew.

"Some people are saying ""oh know another movie based on a true story"" and other are saying ""chess cannot be exciting in real life the movie is making chess seem like more than it is"" that is wrong. This was a real match that took place in 1972 in Iceland during the Cold War and this was just about the most important event taking place for both countries. More people watched this match than the super bowl.. People who didn't even play chess watched the match because it was two countries fighting for the right to say they are ""better"" than the other. This movie looks amazing and I'm really excited, hopefully it will do the actual event justice.

"I really like the Bobby Fischer story, and a few years back I was reading whatever I could find online about him. For those interested, the book ""Frank Brady - Endgame"" is a very good biography of Bobby, and Garbus' documentary ""Bobby Fischer Against the World"" is also a phenomenal account of his life.

Seeing this trailer, I could not help but notice the some over-exaggerated and fictitious stuff like:

- Bobby wearing paperbag mask (this is the first time I've heard about this 'situation') 
- Bobby yelling at Spassky at the beach (Bobby was always very gentlemanly towards Spassky, and that thing clearly never occurred)
- Spassky saying to Bobby ""You don't look well Robert James"" in the middle of a game (Spassky was the ultimate gentleman, and people rarely, if ever, exchange comments at the board)

Maybe these things happened and I just never managed to hear about them, but I am 99% sure they are just fictitious pieces created by the Hollywood nature of the production.

Also the casting choice was a bit strange. While Tobey Maguire (5'9""/175cm) looks a bit like Fischer, he is way shorter than Bobby was (6'2""/188cm). Also Liev Schreiber (6'3""/191cm) resembles Spassky, but he is way taller than Boris was (around 5'7""/170cm).

Anyway, I think I'll still watch this film, and hope to be entertained.",Ugit0twl6zWODXgCoAEC,0,0,2015-05-29T10:35:08Z,xFHvH9FtACg,2015-09-25,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596345/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2015-05-29,119

"""[Chess is] a useful mental exercise. Through the years, many thinkers have been fascinated by it. But I don't enjoy playing. You want to know why? Because it was a game that was born during a brutal age when life counted for little, when everyone believed that some people were worth more than others: kings and pawns. I don't think that anyone is worth more than anyone else... Chess is just a game. Real people aren't pieces. You can't assign more value to some of them than to others. Not to me. Not to anyone. People are not a thing that you can sacrifice. The lesson is, that anyone who looks on the world as if it was a game of chess, deserves to lose.""",UgjbkbQD10ix_3gCoAEC,0,0,2015-05-29T05:13:58Z,xFHvH9FtACg,2015-09-25,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596345/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2015-05-29,119

"I hope they don't portray him as nothing but a maniac. He had some troubles, sure, but that's because he was a genius, and like all genius, they have a hard time dealing with the huge amount of stupid people doing stupid things in this world. The thing for example of not wanting people close when he played is not crazy, chess is a game that requires extreme levels of concentration, which is really hard to do when there is someone whispering or laughing around you.

Despite all of that, he was brilliant. He took on everyone and destroyed 99% of the competition and had absolutely nobody matching his genius at the time, not even Sparsky who is probably going to be shown in this movie like he was in the same level, HE WASN'T. Sparsky was really really good, but Bobby played what chess players like to call ""beautifully"". He was creative and extremely aggressive. Some chess players thought he played weird, but that's because they couldn't see what he saw.

At the age of 13 he sacrificed a queen to simply destroyed another player. Not impressed? He was 13 and the other player was a MOTHERFUCKING GRAND MASTER. Of course saying that he is the best player that ever lived is a little hard to prove, since the game has evolved beyond what he was capable to do at the time, but who is to say he couldn't keep up or develop more himself.

I'm pretty sure Magnus Carlsen looks at this and wishes he could play him, because he knows what a genius looks like, he is one himself, but he has never talked about Bobby like he was crazy, always talks about him as what he really is: a genius.",UggPCWv9wnK9FXgCoAEC,0,0,2015-05-27T16:59:29Z,xFHvH9FtACg,2015-09-25,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596345/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2015-05-27,121

"Holy cow!  Does every single movie trailer over the globe -- despite subject matter or production company -- start with a three second wide exterior establishing shot to hammer the film is ""urban""?  Beyond cliche...Yet another trendy hipster ""relationship"" movie wherein the characters' identity and self-worth is predicated on ""pair bonding"", while spewing immature trivia in an attempt to be ""clever"" while insulting the audience's intelligence by assuming everyone has the depth of a thirteen year old girl at a slumber party.  Not to mention bad lighting, bad framing, bad dialogue, bad directing, bad production design, over-the-top manic acting for no known reason....  Stereotypes abound... Have the producers/cast/crew ever seen a healthy, happy, successful, self-actualized adult?  Basis of critic?  Educational?  Absolutely not.  Inspiring?  God forbid.  Original?  Not even close.

Why is everyone so concerned that the main character is white? oh no there are white doctors and all the natives are in a war torn country with diseases. That's literally just what happens in real life. isn't she suppose to be African as well? If you don't like a movie (that isn't even out yet) because it's main character has a certain skin color then you don't have to watch it. Although I think that's a pretty dumb reason not watch a movie because of the main character's skin color.,Ugg-W3AZyYJrc3gCoAEC,0,0,2017-07-18T15:20:17Z,q7paunSCVus,2017-07-28,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3286560/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2017-07-18,10
"I feel like Ive seen this movie a thousand times before. Tell me something... why is it in movies like this there's always a budding romance between two white do-gooders, with impoverished and war ravaged black Africans as a backdrop? I find that awkward and of exploitative because the image of the white saviors of Africans is used as a way to show how virtuous the white characters are.  I also think that sometimes white liberals have a sort of fetish for black people suffering, because it makes them feel not only paternal but also having a sexual/romantic encounter in the dangerous wilds of Africa turns them on in a weird way. On a side note, where are the love stories of black Africans. They fall in love too ya know.",Ugh1xz5Qy4NivHgCoAEC,0,0,2017-06-29T07:24:58Z,q7paunSCVus,2017-07-28,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3286560/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2017-06-29,29

"Madame Bovary isn't a 'classic love story'. It's a story about a woman who has a string of affairs because she's 'bored' with her husband, alienates all of her lovers (during which time she neglects and alienates her only child), accrues overwhelming debt, blames men for all her problems, and then commits suicide by eating arsenic, which, by the by, is probably the worst way to commit suicide because death by arsenic is painful, drawn out, and completely lacking in dignity.

"It's better to die knowing a little love than to live not knowing it at all. Sex and affairs are not love. Love is an everyday choice. Unfortunately hollywood has made many men and women believe that true and real love is unachievable. It is not. If you decide today to love someone despite their flaws, do it for them and for who they are you'd see that love is what you have to give in order to receive,its not what you get but what you give. With love the only way to gain is give it all away... For me its easy to love my husband even tho he annoys me sometimes. I everyday choose to love him for who he is and not for what I want him to be. And some might not like this but I believe and love Jesus Christ and that love makes me feel whole so I don't rely on my husband or career to make me feel complete. ",UgjUnkrmjown03gCoAEC,0,2,2015-03-19T21:32:26Z,La-clCmfWGo,2015-06-12,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2334733/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2015-03-19,85

The_Howler One need not have to indianise everything. I think Ben Kingsley did a wonderful job given the fact that he has reprised the role of Gandhi about 2 decades back in the movie with the same name. To me it is another feather of achievement in his great acting career. For a British actor to do the role of an Indian and that of a Sardar is nothing short of an accomplishment.,Ugg_ejQ_ve-zvHgCoAEC,0,0,2015-07-13T18:36:07Z,IThfFYmEGEs,2015-08-28,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3062976/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2015-07-13,46

"Why is everyone upset over Ben Kingsley getting the role over a real Sikh? It's not a big deal! At least they portrayed the character with respect and authenticity as far as I can see from the trailer [For example, take note of 1:49 wherein Kingley is shown with a kanga and juda (hair knot)]. Atleast his turban is not a fake cap turban and his beard is not stylized like no tommorow like in Bollywood. Even Bollywood films have failed to give this much attention to detail and respect.

Please wake up, this is progress for Sikhs around the world. People will get to know us, and be familiar with us; stories form the ultimate bond. It is normalization of our image folks. Everyone needs to stop being so uptight and realize the true benefits of such things. There is nothing wrong with Kingsley playing this role

His representation of a normal working class Sikh is spot on, so you guys need to stop being so critical. but yes, it would be nice to see more Indians in Hollywood ( not playing stereotypical characters)

We need movies like this to remind people how desperately close we are to losing what small progress was made by so many movements, so many ordinary people who were willing to stand up, even risk ruining their lives in order to push our nation closer towards the possibility of a fair, equal, and truly democratic country where ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" could be a possibility for every citizen.

  A democracy cannot exist when the the government is not transparent.  How can there be a democracy ""by and for the people"" when we have so many branches of secret police, military forces, not to mention the NSA!  And remember, we have only been given a small peak into what they are up to thanks to the courage of these brave individuals putting their whole world at risk for the sake of saving our freedoms, what democracy we have...

"As an American, I love how ppl always talk about the symphonic Russian style of weaving, passing, weaving, passing til they get to the net - as a bad thing?

Interestingly after so many years with these Russian guys on our side of the pond we still play like a bunch of Keystone cops compared to them. After all these years.

"SPOILERS!! I dont know what to feel about this movie. When characters in movies act retarded.. I have an hard time feeling something for them. Like an hard time rooting for their success of survival. Didnt bring a map? Retards. Compass? Retards. Phone? Retards. And in the tent when she didnt spray the bear right away. Wtf? You were holding it towards the opening the whole time!? WHY? So fucking stupid. Also she could have sprayed outside their tent at the bears direction right away. That scene and gore was really well crafted. Looked real. But why go all artsy and cut out the sound and shit when she holds his hands as he is draged out of the tent? Takes me out of the movie. And also what was the point of having that fucking wierd dude in the begining of the movie? I was waiting for him to return the whole time. Then nothing? Just boring shit before the bear scene. Ok, he was at the beach at the end. But why have him being the one saving her? I thought he was some sort of random psycho. It felt so missplaced. The bear attack scene was the only good scene for me. Apart from the mute part. The rest was just me pissed of at the boyfriends retarded actions in and about their trip. Which was the major thing that ruined this movie for me. This movie is far from the worst I have ever seen. But this movie could have been so much better. If you can get a hold of it. See it. But there is a good chance you will feel like me after you have seen it. A couple of good scenes.

Reminds me of the time my friend was attacked by a black bear in Northern New Mexico. You see this bear rolls up to camp after my dumb ass friend had cooked chicken and forgot to wash his hands. The bear goes up to my 1st friend in his sleeping bag and swats at him. He rolls like a log. Bear goes up to my next friend and he starts freaking out. Well that wasn't a good idea. Bear bites his head and then my other friend fires the shotgun in the air. Bear runs off. Friends skin is hanging from his head. They wrap a towel around it and hike back home.

The interesting little twist in this movie is that the reason why the bear came near their tent in the first place was because of the guy's injured/bloody toe and him leaving his bloody socks out to dry. The scent of the blood was what probably attracted that bear. The guy should've either buried his socks in the ground or burn them immediately. That seemingly insignifant little incident where the boat fell on his toes probably ended up costing him his life.,UgiqIiig6Y8u9HgCoAEC,1,1,2015-03-24T02:20:11Z,ey9fi6m95vo,2015-08-28,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2944198/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2015-03-24,157

"In my personal opinion I never feel right with ""True Event movies"". To me it always feels kind of tasteless to dramatize real world events like this and it feels a bit wrong on the part of the audience to need a film based on a real event to get a reaction when we had many stories about mass murder in fictional contexts.

It may also be my personal preference. But I also think its a bit too early to have this kind of film made. Most times when a mass murderer or serial killer is made into a film its usually an older case with at least 20 years between the event and the dramatization of the events. Of coarse there are exceptions with true event cases like the amityville horror where the case is still fresh in the air while its being dramatized. But I don't know, maybe someone else could explain it better or contradict me. That is fine since I don't think there are right or wrong answers in whether to adapt a true event.",UghTY7fXlGzSnngCoAEC,0,0,2017-05-27T19:02:39Z,4aGmQGo3hVw,2017-08-18,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5281134/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2017-05-27,83

"Wow this may be the most disgustingly exploitative  film that I'll never see.

Do the morons who made this film not understand that this is exactly what the perpetrator of that massacre wanted? He wanted to become infamous that's why he chose a high profile film to piggyback of the popularity of in order to gain instant notoriety.

No one is interested in seeing the event from his perspective, no one cares how ""depressed"" or ""lonely"" he was as a justification for his act of violence. There's plenty of lonely, depressed people out there and none of them go out and shoot up a theatre full of innocent people. This guy was a psychopath/sociopath and that's all you need to know, he would have done something as abhorrent regardless of his social situation as he was an open and closed case of sociopathy.

If America was more concerned with focusing on the victims of these crimes as opposed to giving the perpetrators ""celebrity status"" then the situation wouldn't keep escalating.

 There have been a countless number of psychologists and psychiatrists who have made public statements advising the media to limit it's coverage of these mass shootings to only focus on the victims and not to mention or publicize the perpetrator, as the media coverage and notoriety is what the perpetrator was wanting to receive from the crime.

Making sociopaths/psychopath's ""celebrities"" is the worst thing you can do as it only encourages other sociopaths/psychopaths to follow in their footsteps and instigates them to also achieve that same level of infamy.

When normal people read about a massacre they are disgusted and upset by the event, when a sociopath/psychopath reads about a massacre they only acknowledge the amount of publicity the perpetrator has managed to achieve.

Profiting from a massacre is one of the most disgusting things another human being can do, especially when the massacre is so recent that surviving victims of that massacre can witness the ""Hollywood version"" of their traumatic experience.",UghyiWv5LFlLA3gCoAEC,0,0,2017-05-02T21:53:35Z,4aGmQGo3hVw,2017-08-18,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5281134/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2017-05-02,108

"Attention to the insane people that feel the need to shoot up places and kill undeserving innocent people...
 
Next time you feel the desire to do this type of thing, can you just stop, take in a deep breathe, and consider the pain you will cause to those who love the people you go after? They will be the ones to suffer the most, not the dead. 

If you still feel the urge, maybe just write out what you want to do and make it into a book or a script for a film where you choose targets that will make the world a better place? I dunno, maybe make it an attack against people with orange faces, giant mouths, and small ""hands""? 

If you want to add some old booze nosed, alt-right, anti-Semitic news corporation owner that like to use the orange faced ones as puppets to bring in their Grey Champion which only helps fuel their Gog/Magog scenarios? That will really make the world of your book a better place. 

Then you might get rich. You can then buy an island to live on where no one will bother you anymore.

"Jobs for the academics, scientists and technicians, and the associated tenderers.  The Big Bang is still a theory after all, so the billions of dollars spent are unjustified.  

With all the talk of multiverse theory with infinite universes, would not the so called Big Bang be in reference to a super galaxy or sub universe of sorts?  Would not then the infinite collection of these infinite universes BE the universe?  Further, when astrophysicists speak of infinity, there also, then, cannot be a beginning - hence no Higgs boson.  

The universe is not an entity, hence it relies on matter and void to make it what it is.

Wow all you ppl are disregarding this film and for what?.. Because ur type casting half of the cast especially Grant Gustin if you would look pass the fact hes on the show the Flash you may surprise urself.. Hey ppl said the same thing about Tobey Maguire that he would always be known as Peter Parker  no matter what other movie he does and look he proved us wrong and made sum great films.. So give these other actors a fair chance to see what they can really do and if you do less analyzing thru critiquing eyes then maybe you can find out how versatile they really that is all,UgzUSW_0hMaI0LcE4ep4AaABAg,0,3,2018-03-28T13:57:39Z,wCc25I_y7oA,2018-04-13,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0835802/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2018-03-28,16

"Looks like the kind of movie we've seen a million times already.

How about make a movie where the protagonist IS the CEO? Where he owns the business that's beginning to go under? Where he cares about the lives of the people he employs, but due to competition and a changing market he needs to lay off more and more workers and close down more and more factories? And in the end, after this man has sacrificed and worked his ass off trying to save the business he built and the people he feels he's responsible for, a whole bunch of angry workers come and burn down his mansion (which has a loan against it and is devoid of furniture because he sold it all in hopes that he can funnel whatever money he can into his failing business).

"In the future when movies and trailers are made by AI that only computes new movies by evaluating old ones, this is what all movies will look like. Workaholic dad--check. Big job opp--check. Cue sad music--check. Disease--double check. Man meaningfully reevaluates life--you get the idea. And, of course, one raving quote from a minor publication that ignores the 20% Rotten Tomatoes rating.  

Gerard Butler is one of the most interesting actors with terrible tastes.

"To all those who are dissapointed with the Mother's character being a  light-skinned woman. I was dissapointed to see it too. This is going to sound naive to some of you but maybe we (the light-skinned ones) are the passage way. 

With time, we will get to see more and more films where the casts are shining in their dark-skinned glory on the big screen in non-exploitative, non-stereotypical, non-derogatory films. As far as THIS film goes it's Lionsgate (a Harvey Weinstein production  company)..that's what THEY want to see plus they're out of touch by thinking WE want to continue seeing this too. 

How many DECADES of film have we sat through where there's just ONE Black/light-skinned or mixed race person in the entire film, with an otherwise all white cast? Or a Black couple in the restaurant or in the club dancing IN THE BACKGROUND AS EXTRAS? Or even no colour whatsover?? I want to hear about light-skinned people in the business having that coversation with the execs and saying, ""Nah I can't play that role with integrity, give (insert fully Black phenotyped actress' name here) a call.""

"Love both these actors.  Yes, Charlie would be an excellent Oliver Queen, but moreover...I have thought for a while(after watching the film ‘71) that Jack O’Connell would make a very interesting James Bond.  I didn’t say 007.  After No Time to Die, I’d go back to the beginning.  Get a young, lean, almost feral recruit into the 00 program.  Sort of see behind the curtain, something we’ve not seen before.  How Bond is shaped and molded into a double O agent.  Then we have this actor who ages and grows into the role as we watch him do so.",UgzNi403sT1DMZZ-xZl4AaABAg,0,0,2020-10-15T22:53:41Z,T0dE_YLghMM,2020-11-06,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8710596/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2020-10-15,22

"Robin Williams was one of the most awesome people to ever live, and even though he's been dead for nearly a year, I've got a feeling Robin's up there in Heaven with George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Rodney Dangerfield, Sam Kinison, and other comic greats who are no longer with us making God and Jesus laugh out loud! :) And I don't agree with people who say that Robin's in Hell, because Hell is reserved for people like Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, Timothy McVeigh, etc. To me, Heaven is for people who don't commit sins and/or might commit minor sins (like drug and/or alcohol abuse, which Robin and the other comedians I mentioned had, but it's never too late to get sober), but Heaven is not for people who commit very serious sins like murders, which Hitler and the other very low life evil people I mentioned did, because my grandma said that if everybody on this earth committed as least one sin (like cursing, using drugs and/or alcohol, etc. but not counting very serious sins like murder), everybody would be in hell, and this is coming from a 24 year old with autism! :) So it's all good! :)",UgjN9Y1oBWdcbXgCoAEC,0,1,2015-06-28T08:26:33Z,HCdUubr70i8,2015-07-10,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2624412/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2015-06-28,12

 Always loved Robin Williams always will. A very skillful man and a heart filled man. Just a shame he went on so long alone in his mind. And to those who read this and think im being pertenous I'm not. Some people truly do have proplems with the little negigitive voice in their head. Always at the back of their mind beating them down, holding them back, telling them untrue words. I had that myself for a while and never realised it until I found out Robin Williams  that semmed so happy and made other people's life's so full and joyful had the same little voice poisoning him. So instead of saying R I P for Robin Williams the man. I made sure I fight back my little voice for him to make sure he is never forgotten. And of course you. Yes the person typing that horrible little comment just think maybe you write such horrid things is because you have thay little voice too. So take a minute and view your own life before you comment on other people's views.

"If we ignore the corpse swinging at the end of a rope in the foyer, I suppose we can ignore anything. Like this movie. Robin was remarkably bad in pickiing his movies over the past fifteen years and I suppose it will do some nostalgia business because of his suicide but it will be on cinemax in a month and celebrity trash magazine will have to invent more suicide notes. Personally I think Robin was rehearsing his new comedy act about David Carradine's last orgasm when the rope slipped, or his gold digging wife slipped him a mickey, did the rope thing and pushed him down in the closet saying ""Oopsie. Happy trails, robbie.""  Man had some cash, don't underestimate that, and we all know what a gold digger can do to cheer up a depressed man. In a case like this with all the press, there has to be more than definitive evidence of foul play. There has to be prints, a forged note, a confession and a public outcry, and even then a DA would be hesitant to prosecute for fear of looking bad and losing the next election. If the dude was poor the widow would be behind bars in a week and the DA would proudly bellow ""next.""",UgidGnLkqOoVPHgCoAEC,0,0,2015-06-25T11:18:55Z,HCdUubr70i8,2015-07-10,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2624412/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2015-06-25,15

"I will admit I cried real tears. He's so far the only actor I've felt truly distressed over. Robin Williams is one of those actors where you didn't think about it, you didn't think he'd ever die, he was there in our childhoods, our teen years, and our adulthood. He's one of those actors where you smile just seeing him. Even in his worst work just seeing him made you smile a bit cause he seemed to enjoy doing what he did so much. And then you hear about the charity work he did, how much he wanted to help people, he just seemed to love making people happy. 

If I could turn back time it would be to give this man a hug. He seemed so happy, so full of life, its hard to believe and imagine seeing him in any other way. It goes to show that the way a person is, isn't all that they really are. But at the same time, how many of us wished we could have helped him you know? How many of us wished we knew so that we could tell him every day how much he meant to us as an actor. Its still just so heart breaking.

Now, a movie had been released with him, and suddenly everyone cares again.

I bet if they made a movie on the school shootings, they'd start remembering them and crying, but only for show. These people don't necessarily care do they?

You're lying. He isn't dead."" I couldn't believe it. I refused to believe it. We had already lost so many celebrities that year, and I refused to believe that he would be another one of them. She continued, ""They think it's suicide."" I went into my bedroom, and that's where my dad found me about an hour later, sobbing.

O Captain! My Captain! rise up and hear the bells;Rise up — for you the flag is flung — for you the bugle trills;For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths — for you the shores a-crowding;For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning Here Captain! dear father!This arm beneath your head;It is some dream that on the deck,You've fallen cold and dead.

My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!But I with mournful tread,Walk the deck my Captain lies,Fallen cold and dead.",Ugg5REHeUg0eXHgCoAEC,0,0,2015-06-19T16:17:25Z,HCdUubr70i8,2015-07-10,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2624412/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2015-06-19,21

It's going to make lots of money just like Furious 7 and even way back with the Dark Knight. It's weird how people flock to the theaters to see dead actors in their final performances like this. Especially when before Robin Williams died everybody said he wasn't funny anymore and his movies sucked. You think buying a ticket really matters now? Same thing with Heath Ledger and his Joker. Everyone said he would suck because he's just the 'gay guy from Brokeback Mountain' but nope he was amazing all of a sudden after he died. I'm not taking from their performances or anything but I am saying that death factors into the success of a movie and we seem to be nice after they are gone...,UghNDbiKy6HkWXgCoAEC,0,0,2015-06-19T12:45:37Z,HCdUubr70i8,2015-07-10,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2624412/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2015-06-19,21

"I'm not sure I'll make it through the movie in one piece.  You hear about how people are affected by the death of famous people, but till Robin, I never entirely understood it.  Here I am though and his passing seems to have hit me harder than the passing of any family member (a short list that does include my birth mother, who I barely knew and a grandfather from my adopted family).  I still feel a sickening sort of feeling in my gut when I think about it and it still brings a bit of a tear to my eyes.  I'm still struggling to understand and to bring peace to that small section of my mind.  I can't help but wonder if like so many others, were the signs there?  Or was this really spontaneous like so much of his work?

I'll wrap this up with the idea that had his death been natural, no matter when, I think I could've dealt with it better.  Knowing the man I idolized felt his life should end by his own hands has weakened my foundation and I am still rebuilding.  I wonder if seeing this movie would help or if it would only do more damage.",Ugh90hNCrDtLkXgCoAEC,0,0,2015-06-19T12:25:03Z,HCdUubr70i8,2015-07-10,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2624412/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2015-06-19,21

This was so hard to watch I grew up on Robin Williams all my favorite movies were ones he acted in. It's still kind of surreal that he is gone. This movie maybe one I will watch at home when it comes out due to I'm a blubber baby and this will make me tear up watching him. Heck I cried watching night of the museum at the end when he says good bye. Robin with always hold a special place in my heart as he will for many others. Truly a wonderful man and actor and comedic. ,Ugg1lWdsqs3z_HgCoAEC,0,0,2015-06-19T02:38:50Z,HCdUubr70i8,2015-07-10,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2624412/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2015-06-19,21

"People need to understand they have just postponed the release of this movie to milk the whole ""last robin Williams move ever"" marketing. This movie was released at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 20, 2014. That was a month before the principle photography of Night at the Museum was even completed. 

So just saying a movie that came out 8 months before in theaters and a month before Night at the Museum was even completed is somehow the final movie hes in.

"The title of the novel The Catcher in the Rye
 (1951) by J. D. Salinger comes from the poem's name. Holden Caulfield, 
the protagonist, misinterprets a part of this poem to mean ""if a body 
catch a body"" rather than ""if a body meet a body."" He keeps picturing 
children playing in a field of rye near the edge of a cliff, and him 
catching them when they start to fall off.",Ugg_pXDPGwwDPngCoAEC,0,4,2016-09-23T03:00:40Z,8TDZunxXQ1o,2016-10-14,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4048168/?ref_=adv_li_tt,2016-09-23,21
